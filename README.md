## Tips
- After cloning the project to your development folder, run `npm install`
- Start your development by the files `src/js/main.js` and `src/scss/index.scss`.
- After doing the modifications, run `npm run build:dev` (to generate a dev bundle) or `npm run build:production` (to generate a production bundle).
- And then, just insert the bundle files in your html file (assets/js/bundle.js or assets/css/bundle.css).
